In the societi of hi nephew and niece, and their\\r\\nchildren, the old gentleman\\' day were comfort spent.  his\\r\\nattach to them all increased.  the constant attent of mr. and\\r\\nmrs. henri dashwood to hi wishes, which proceed not mere from\\r\\ninterest, but from good of heart, gave him everi degre of solid\\r\\ncomfort which hi age could receive; and the cheer of the\\r\\nchildren ad a relish to hi existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nbi a former marriage, mr. henri dashwood had one son: by hi present\\r\\nlady, three daughters.  the son, a steadi respect young man, was\\r\\nampli provid for by the fortun of hi mother, which had been large,\\r\\nand half of which devolv on him on hi come of age.  By hi own\\r\\nmarriage, likewise, which happen soon afterwards, he ad to his\\r\\nwealth.  To him therefor the success to the norland estat wa not\\r\\nso realli import as to hi sisters; for their fortune, independent\\r\\nof what might aris to them from their father\\' inherit that\\r\\nproperty, could be but small.  their mother had nothing, and their\\r\\nfath onli seven thousand pound in hi own disposal; for the\\r\\nremain moieti of hi first wife\\' fortun wa also secur to her\\r\\nchild, and he had onli a life-interest in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nth old gentleman died: hi will wa read, and like almost everi other\\r\\nwill, gave as much disappoint as pleasure.  He wa neither so\\r\\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leav hi estat from hi nephew;--but\\r\\nh left it to him on such term as destroy half the valu of the\\r\\nbequest.  mr. dashwood had wish for it more for the sake of hi wife\\r\\nand daughter than for himself or hi son;--but to hi son, and his\\r\\nson\\' son, a child of four year old, it wa secured, in such a way, as\\r\\nto leav to himself no power of provid for those who were most dear\\r\\nto him, and who most need a provis by ani charg on the estate, or\\r\\nbi ani sale of it valuabl woods.  the whole wa tie up for the\\r\\nbenefit of thi child, who, in occasion visit with hi father and\\r\\nmoth at norland, had so far gain on the affect of hi uncle, by\\r\\nsuch attract as are by no mean unusu in children of two or three\\r\\nyear old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desir of have his\\r\\nown way, mani cun tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\\r\\nal the valu of all the attent which, for years, he had received\\r\\nfrom hi niec and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,\\r\\nand, as a mark of hi affect for the three girls, he left them a\\r\\nthousand pound a-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nmr. dashwood\\' disappoint was, at first, severe; but hi temper was\\r\\ncheer and sanguine; and he might reason hope to live mani years,\\r\\nand by live economically, lay by a consider sum from the produce\\r\\nof an estat alreadi large, and capabl of almost immediate\\r\\nimprovement.  but the fortune, which had been so tardi in coming, was\\r\\nhi onli one twelvemonth.  He surviv hi uncl no longer; and ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, includ the late legacies, wa all that remain for\\r\\nhi widow and daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nhi son wa sent for as soon as hi danger wa known, and to him mr.\\r\\ndashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgenc which illness\\r\\ncould command, the interest of hi mother-in-law and sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nmr. john dashwood had not the strong feel of the rest of the\\r\\nfamily; but he wa affect by a recommend of such a natur at\\r\\nsuch a time, and he promis to do everi thing in hi power to make\\r\\nthem comfortable.  hi father wa render easi by such an assurance,\\r\\nand mr. john dashwood had then leisur to consid how much there might\\r\\nprud be in hi power to do for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nh wa not an ill-dispos young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\r\\nand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\r\\nrespected; for he conduct himself with proprieti in the discharg of\\r\\nhi ordinari duties.  had he marri a more amiabl woman, he might\\r\\nhav been made still more respect than he was:--h might even have\\r\\nbeen made amiabl himself; for he wa veri young when he married, and\\r\\nveri fond of hi wife.  but mrs. john dashwood wa a strong caricature\\r\\nof himself;--mor narrow-mind and selfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen he gave hi promis to hi father, he medit within himself to\\r\\nincreas the fortun of hi sister by the present of a thousand\\r\\npound a-piece.  He then realli thought himself equal to it.  the\\r\\nprospect of four thousand a-year, in addit to hi present income,\\r\\nbesid the remain half of hi own mother\\' fortune, warm his\\r\\nheart, and made him feel capabl of generosity.-- \"yes, he would give\\r\\nthem three thousand pounds: it would be liber and handsome! It would\\r\\nb enough to make them complet easy.  three thousand pounds! he\\r\\ncould spare so consider a sum with littl inconvenience.\"-- he\\r\\nthought of it all day long, and for mani day successively, and he did\\r\\nnot repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nno sooner wa hi father\\' funer over, than mrs. john dashwood,\\r\\nwithout send ani notic of her intent to her mother-in-law,\\r\\narriv with her child and their attendants.
